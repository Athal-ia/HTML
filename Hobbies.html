	<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
	<h3><ins>Hello again. <br> I don't know why would you want to know more about me, but Welcome anyway!</ins></h3>
	<br>
	<p>
		My hobbies are reading, listening to music, daydreaming, and talking to myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started reading novels in 5<sup>th</sup> grade. It was a novel series by Laura Inggals Wilder. After that, I just started to read every novels I can get my hands into.
		<br>
		My favourite authors are Cassandra Clare and Rick Riordan. Sometimes when I read, I kind of forget that I'm reading. It feels like I'm actually inside the book. I really really love reading.
	</p>
	<p>
		I always love music. I never really have any fixed genres. If the song flows, it flows. My favourite songs/singers/bands are all from different genre.
