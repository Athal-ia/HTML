	<h1>Adriane Athalia</h1>
	<h3><ins>Hello ladies and gentlment and anything in between and beyond. <br> Welcome to my humble biodata webpage, and enjoy your short stay!</ins></h3>
	<br>
	<p>
		I am Athalia, college student at Satya Wacana Christian University. I major in Technology Information, which is not as cool as it sound. I just started college this year, and I am very new to all of this.
		<br>
		Making this personal web, for example. Thankyou very much to google, youtube, and my brother's book for this miracle, or I might still be stuck on heading 1 and paragraph.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn't get any computer education in Senior High School, so keeping up with my college education is not easy at all. In a matter of fact, it is rather difficult. I'm trying my best to love what I learn. Key word 'trying'.

		I was born on the 25<sup>th</sup> of June 2001, in Jayapura. I lived there for 5 years until my family and I moved to Salatiga. To be perfectly honest, I would have prefer to stay in Jayapura. At least there, I don't have to learn Javanese.
