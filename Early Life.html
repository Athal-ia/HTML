	<h2>Early Life</h2>


	<h3><ins>Hello again. <br> I don't know why would you want to know more about me, but Welcome anyway!</ins></h3>
	<br>
	<p>
		I was born on the 25<sup>th</sup> of June 2001, in Jayapura. I lived there for 5 years until my family and I moved to Salatiga. I have an older brother and an older sister. My brother is 16 years older then me and my sister is 13 years older then me. The age gap is nice, because sometimes it feels like I'm the only child.
	</p>
	<p>
		My father passed away when I was 7, so my mother basically raised me by herself. I don't really have that many memories with my father since he was always work so far away, but the memories that I do have are all pleasant.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went to Christian 4 Elementary School Eben Heazer Salatiga. I remember I used to be bullied a lot. Other then that, Elementary School is a cool time. 
		<br>
		I have a lot of friends. Granted, they were boys. But when you're a child, being friends with boys are better then being friends with girls.
		<br>
		Girls can be really mean. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Then I went to Christian 2 <acronym title="Junior High School">JHS</acronym> Eben Heazer Salatiga. I met 4 people who then become my best friend for 3 years (or more). We haven't talked since forever. I like being in Junior High School because the lessons are fairly easy.
	</p>
	<p>
		And then I went to Christian 1 <acronym title="Senior High School">SHS</acronym> Salatiga. There, I met another 3 person who become my best friend. Senior High School is by far, the time I am most happy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now I'm in college. I only have 1 of my best friend here in <acronym title="Satya Wacana Christian University">SWCU</acronym>, and that makes me sad.
		<br>
		I've met a lot of nice people here. I managed to get myself some friends. But I found some new friends here. I hope my years in college will be memorable.
